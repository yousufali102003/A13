Mini Project (PROJ2999) Outcome: (Summary in 3-6 bullet points):

 - Developed a prototype detecting helmet usage using proximity sensors.  

 - Validated the helmet detection system, which buzzes an alarm upon helmet detection.  

 - Explored and applied microcontroller-based systems.  

 - Gained knowledge about sensor integration and real-time testing processes.

 

 

 

 

 

Extended Project Abstract (up to 300 words)

The Safe Guard IoT-Based Smart Helmet Accessory project introduces an innovative system designed to promote road safety by ensuring that riders wear helmets. This IoT-based accessory can be retrofitted into existing helmets to detect helmet usage and prevent the bike engine from starting if the helmet is not worn. By leveraging affordable proximity sensors, a microcontroller, and wireless communication technology, the system addresses the affordability barrier, making it accessible to a wider audience.  

 

This project emphasizes practicality, aiming to enhance helmet usage compliance without requiring the purchase of entirely new helmets. Expected results include a fully functional, affordable, and user-friendly smart accessory that integrates seamlessly with existing helmets, ensuring engine ignition only when the rider wears the helmet.
