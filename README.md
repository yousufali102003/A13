# Safe Guard IoT-Based Smart Helmet Accessory

## Project Overview
The **Safe Guard IoT-Based Smart Helmet Accessory** is an innovative solution designed to enhance road safety. This IoT-based accessory can be retrofitted into existing helmets to ensure that riders comply with helmet usage regulations. The system prevents the bike engine from starting unless the helmet is worn, using proximity sensors, a microcontroller, and wireless communication technologies.

## Key Features
- Ensures bike engine ignition only when the helmet is worn.
- User-friendly design compatible with existing helmets.
- Affordable and accessible solution promoting road safety and helmet compliance.

## Objectives
- Develop an IoT-based accessory to enforce helmet usage for bike engine ignition.
- Design a system compatible with a wide range of existing helmets.
- Provide an affordable and effective road safety solution.

## Mini Project Outcomes
- Developed a prototype detecting helmet usage via proximity sensors.
- Implemented an alarm system upon helmet detection.
- Gained expertise in microcontroller systems, sensor integration, and real-time testing.
